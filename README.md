# Breach Data Checker – Self-Hosted Retro Edition

A privacy-focused breach lookup tool with a **monochrome retro UI** inspired by early Macintosh and Windows 98 aesthetics.  
Upload or paste an email/username → instantly check it against your **own breach dataset** (CSV, JSON, TXT, etc.) without sending data to any external API.

---

## Features
- **Self-Hosted** – No external lookups, keep your breach list local.
- **Monochrome Retro UI** – Old-school Macintosh/Windows 98 look.
- **Responsive** – Fits any screen, scrollable when needed.
- **File Upload & Paste** – Supports drag-and-drop or manual input.
- **Instant Match Highlighting** – Results appear instantly with no reload.
- **Lightweight** – Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Why?
Most breach checkers send your email/username to a third-party API. This is **not private**.  
This app keeps your sensitive queries and breach database **offline and in your control**.
